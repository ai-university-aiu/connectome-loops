/*  Connectome slice — the Causalontology 2.0.0 structure validator.

    Loads the slice's minted structure records (causal_map) and validates every
    one against PrologAI's UNMODIFIED Causalontology 2.0.0 conformance engine:
      - co_validate_schema/4  — the record satisfies its kind's JSON schema
        (whole-word schemes, the seventeen kinds, additionalProperties:false).
      - causal_core_validate_semantics/3 — the local semantic rules hold.
      - the cortisol CRO classifies as SKIPPING with NO skip-gap (skips:true, so
        the absence of a mechanism is a POSITIVE FINDING, not a gap).
      - the signed provenance assertion VERIFIES (Ed25519).
    It also writes each record to structure/<name>.json as an inspectable
    artifact. Exit 0 iff every record is valid and every check passes.
